In this folder you will see the Master File and a list of subfolders of different parameters measured by the Muskegon Lake Observatory Buoy (MLO)

USE THE MASTER EXCEL FILE TO GET SIMPLE BUOY DATA

Master file contains spreadsheets of the same edited data from files within each parameters folder, just combined into one single file
There are no data in the Master file that aren't in files in the parameter folders
Parameter folders are where unedited and edited files are located for any QA/QC purposes and transparency
	For example, chl and phyco data are a combination of 2 different types of sensors (YSI and Turner) as well as the bottom-most water temp (YSI and NEXSENS)
	So original data and combined data can all be seen in these folders as a matter of transparency
	Notes on data are contained in the edit file for each parameter as well

Data are from 2011 through 2019

Parameters Completed to date:
	Meteorological
	Water Temperature
	Dissolved Oxygen
	Chlorophyll a & Phycocyanin
	YSI Depth
	Nitrate
	PAR (photosynthetically active radiation)
	pH & ORP
	Specific Conductivity
	Turbidity
